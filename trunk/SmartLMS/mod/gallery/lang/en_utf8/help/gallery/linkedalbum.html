<p align="center"><b>Linked Album</b></p>

<p>This is the root Gallery album that this Moodle Gallery Module is linked to.  If an album has already been linked to another 
    Moodle Gallery Module, then that album does not appear in the list.</p>

<p><strong>When changing</strong> from one album to another, then the behavior of the 
    <em>Album title</em>, <em>Album summary</em>, <em>Album description</em>, and <em>Album keywords</em> changes
    slighly.
    <ul>
        <li>If any of the above four fields are not empty, then the newly linked album will be updated
            with the field value.</li>
        <li>If any of the above four fields are empty, then the newly linked album retains its original
            value for that field.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
    Examples:
    <p class="indent">If the <em>Album summary</em> is left blank, then the newly linked album's summary
    will retain its original value.</p>
    <p class="indent">If the <em>Album summary</em> has text, then the newly linked album's summary
    will be changed to the entered text.</p>
    
<p><strong>When not changing</strong> from one album to another, then whatever value entered for those four fields will be set in 
    the linked album.</p>
    Example:
    <p class="indent">If the <em>Album summary</em> is left blank, then the linked album's summary
    will be set to nothing.</p>
