<p align="center"><b>Path to Gallery2 Directory</b></p>

<p>This is the location to your Gallery2 directory.  The path can be an absolute path or it can be relative 
    to the root directory of your Moodle installation</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="indent">
    <p>Your moodle install is located here:
        <ul><li>/home/example/public_html</li></ul></p>

    <p>And you have installed Gallery2 in another directory:<br />
        <ul><li>/home/example/public_html/gallery2</li></ul></p>

    <p>So the two paths that you could enter are:
        <ul>
            <li>the relative path: /gallery2/</li>
            <li>or the absolute path: /home/example/public_html/gallery2/</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<p>Note: the trailing / at the end of the path is <strong>required</strong>.</p>
