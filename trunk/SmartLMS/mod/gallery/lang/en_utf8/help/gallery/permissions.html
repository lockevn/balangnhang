<p align="center"><b>Permission Handling</b></p>

<p>One can either handle permissions via Moodle Gallery Module and its interface or handle permissions
    manually via Gallery2's permission interface</p>

<p>It is <strong>not</strong> recommended to switch this setting often.  It is best to figure out how you will handle
    permissions and stick to it.</p>
    
<p>If this setting is turned <strong>On</strong> then Moodle Gallery Module will enforce the teacher and 
    student privleges set in the modules configuration in each Moodle Gallery Module instance.</p>
<p>If this setting is turned <strong>Off</strong> then Moodle Gallery Module will not enforce the teacher and 
    student privleges and trust that the Gallery2 install will be configured correctly with the proper
    permissions.</p>
