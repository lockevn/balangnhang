<p>
The Gallery module allows for the embedded use of <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/" title="Gallery 2" target="_BLANK">Gallery 2</a>.
For each Gallery instance in Moodle, a Gallery 2 album is created.  The two are linked and when one enters a Gallery instance, it 
will appear as if that user has a blank album to upload pictures, create new sub-albums, add comments, etc.
</p>
<p>
Gallery instances can even be backed-up and restored!  The backup procedure copies over Gallery 2's albums, sub-albums, images,
and comments (including all details associated with each item) that are related to a specific Gallery instance.  Restore will then
recreate the before mentioned items to their original, backed-up state into Gallery 2; creating a new Gallery instance.
